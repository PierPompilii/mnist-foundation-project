# MNIST Foundation Project

This project is a **digit recognition web application** built using a deep learning model trained on the MNIST dataset. Users can draw or upload a digit, and the app will use a trained PyTorch model to predict what digit (0–9) it is, along with the model’s confidence.

##  Purpose

This project is part of my application for the **Machine Learning Institute’s Deep Learning Residency Programme**. It's designed to demonstrate:

- My ability to build an end-to-end machine learning application
- My understanding of model training, inference, and deployment
- My motivation to dive deeper into deep learning

I’m just starting out in this field and learning everything hands-on — from Python and PyTorch to Docker and deployment. This project is both a learning journey and a stepping stone toward becoming a deep learning practitioner.

## What’s Inside?

-  **Model Training:** A simple CNN trained on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch
-  **Streamlit Web App:** Users can draw or upload a digit, and get real-time predictions
-  **PostgreSQL Logging:** Every prediction and feedback is stored in a database
-  **Dockerized:** Everything runs in containers for easy deployment and portability
-  **Ready to Deploy:** Built to be deployed on a self-managed server with Docker Compose
